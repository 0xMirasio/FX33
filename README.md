# FX33 Algorithm
Welcome ! 
The FX33 encryption is a script made in python which use fibonnaci numbers and Zekendorf decomposition with some probability and base changement. 
This project is under developement, many bugs are still present and this is not the final code. 
Edit: The code don't work for now due to a bug related to string decomposition

You can download for free the scripts and use/modify it for GNU/open source utilisation.
If you want to report a bug or make some discuss, you can contact me at my mail : thibault.poncetta@gmail.com

NEXT developement : 

-Encryption of any file.
-Graphical Interface developement

CHANGELOG :

V04:
- Added a primary key/password which regulate probability to secure decryption process
- Added a secondary key which regulate the ratio of creation of caracters in the encryption. if the key is at max levels, it will rise the volume of the string/file 
- Bugs Removed 

V03:
- Add of an FX base in an extern librairies, ASCII base present bugs and problems in python and identification.
- Bugs removed

V02:
- creation of the decryption script FX33

V01:
- creation of the encryption script FX33
