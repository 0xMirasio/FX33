# FX33 Algorithm
Welcome ! 
The FX33 encryption is a script made in python which use fibonnaci numbers and Zekendorf decomposition with some probability and base changement. 
Use the scripts to encode your files or password !
Edit: You can use now FX33.exe to decrypt crypted file. 

Ps : if you encode a file with encrypt_file.py, use uncrypt_file.py to decode it or it will not work.
This project is under developement, many bugs are still present and this is not the final code. 

You can download for free the scripts and use/modify it for GNU/open source utilisation.
If you want to report a bug or make some discuss, you can contact me at my mail : thibault.poncetta@gmail.com

CHANGELOG :

-v07 : 
Encryption of binary/photo/video file is now possible (use encrypt_file/decrypt_file for text file).
Use encrypt_binary/decrypt_binary to use the algorithm.

-v06:
Added a graphical software ! Open FX33.exe and decrypt file.

v05:
-Added file encryption : just specify a file and it will crypt it. Decode it with the uncrypt_file script

V04:
- Added a primary key/password which regulate probability to secure decryption process
- Bugs Removed 

V03:
- Add of an FX base in an extern librairies, ASCII base present bugs and problems in python and identification.
- Bugs removed

V02:
- creation of the decryption script FX33

V01:
- creation of the encryption script FX33
